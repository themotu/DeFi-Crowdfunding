# DeFi-Crowdfunding
This is a 4 day project I made. It took 3 days, because I did front-end for it as well, but here is the back-end.

It could seem as very simple, but it does everything I wanted it to do.

* It's decentralized
* Everything that a DeFi Crowdfunding site needs is in the contract
* The code is optimized
* It's written from scratch by myself

If you find it interesting, don't hesitate to use it.
